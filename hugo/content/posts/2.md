Fully homomorphic encryption is an encryption scheme that allows some operations on encrypted data. This results from some properties of ring homomorphism (from abstrct algebra). We will get into the introduction to ring homomorphism to understand what is happening later. The first post is going to be mainly on a high-level understanding of what a fully homomorphic encryption is, what it brings, what the current problems around fully homomorphic encryption are, and the future of it.
